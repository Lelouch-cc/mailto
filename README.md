## Usage

Most likely, you want to launch the email client on the phone with certain fields pre-filled.

```dart
import 'package:mailto/mailto.dart';
// Optional, but most likely what you want
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

// Somewhere in your app
launchMailto() async {
  final mailtoLink = Mailto(
    to: ['to@example.com'],
    cc: ['cc1@example.com', 'cc2@example.com'],
    subject: 'mailto example subject',
    body: 'mailto example body',
  );
  // Convert the Mailto instance into a string.
  // Use either Dart's string interpolation
  // or the toString() method.
  await launch('$mailtoLink');
}
```

Use [`url_launcher`](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) for launching the links you create with the `mailto` package.
