# mailto_example

This is a Flutter example app of the [`mailto` package](https://pub.dev/packages/mailto).

Work in progress.

To-dos:

* The sections' leading icons should change from filled to outlined depending on whether the section is enabled.
* Make sure users can hide their keyboard.
* Add pictures and video of the example app
